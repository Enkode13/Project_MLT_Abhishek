# ML Apprentice Take Home - Sentence Transformer & Multi-Task Learning

## Overview

This project implements:
- A **Sentence Transformer** for generating sentence embeddings.
- A **Multi-Task Learning** (MTL) model built on top of the transformer.
- Two tasks:
  - **Task A**: Sentence Classification
  - **Task B**: Sentiment Analysis
- A **Training Loop** supporting multi-task training.

Designed according to provided evaluation criteria focusing on **clarity**, **structure**, and **explanations**.

## Model Architecture Details

### Task 1: Sentence Transformer
- Base model: `bert-base-uncased`
- Mean Pooling on token embeddings to get sentence embeddings.

### Task 2: Multi-Task Expansion
- Task A Head: 3-way Classification MLP
- Task B Head: 2-way Sentiment Analysis MLP
- Shared BERT backbone with two task-specific heads.

### Task 3: Training Considerations
- Detailed freezing strategies.
- Transfer Learning scenarios discussed.

### Task 4: Training Loop
- Separate loss computation for Task A and Task B.
- Simulated dummy data for testing.
